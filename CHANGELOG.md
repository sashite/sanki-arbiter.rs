# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented in this file. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-13

Aligns the crate with the revised Sanki adjudication specifications
(per-player step semantics, residual resignation, equivocation-only
violations, ordered post-chain resolution).

### Changed — breaking

- **Per-player step semantics.** A Ply's `step` is now the signer's own move
  ordinal (kind `6423` §Step semantics and play order); the slot is
  `(session, signer, step)` and the natural-state chain consumes slots in the
  interleaved play order — within each step value, side `first` before side
  `second`. `SessionParams::expected_side` / `expected_signer` are replaced by
  `side_at(half_move)`, `step_at(half_move)`, and `player_at(half_move)`;
  `NaturalState::next_step` is renamed `next_half_move`.
- **Residual, turn-independent resignation.** A conforming, canonically
  attested Request from a session player now always yields a verdict: the
  post-chain resolution is ordered draw acceptance (`agreement`) → abandonment
  timeout (`timeout`, the on-move player's clock) → residual `resignation`
  (decisive against the invoker, whatever the turn). There is no "premature"
  invocation anymore; `adjudicate` returns `None` only for an unattested
  Request or a non-player signer. `implicit::implicit_termination` is replaced
  by `implicit::draw_acceptance`.
- **Equivocation-only violations.** The step-ownership violation is
  structurally inexpressible under per-player steps and is removed.
  `commitment::commitment_violation` / `Violation` / `ViolationKind` become
  `commitment::equivocation` / `Equivocation` (single-content rule only,
  applicable to every slot including pending ones, anchored at the
  second-attested differing Ply).

### Unchanged

- Race resolution (canonical attestation, canonical ply) and its tiebreaks.
- Chain-replay terminations: an illegal or unparseable evaluated Ply rules
  `illegalmove`; rule-system endings and played-Ply timeouts carry their Ply's
  attestation as anchor.
- The candidate ranking by attestation time, an equivocation winning an exact
  tie.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-08

Initial release: abstract event model (`Ply`, `Attestation`,
`AdjudicationRequest`), race resolution, natural state, commitment violations,
implicit terminations, and the `adjudicate` orchestration over
`sashite-sanki-engine`.
